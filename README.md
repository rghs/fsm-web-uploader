# FSM Web Uploader

A simple Python FTP client designed for uploading FS Manager generated websites without uploading all of the judges panels until after the start of the event.

Almost definitely of no interest to 99.99% of people, but if you're that one guy who needs this, you are more than welcome to use it (in accordance with the terms of the license :) ).
